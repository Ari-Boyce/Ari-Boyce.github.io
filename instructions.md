1. display 28 of the same image in a grid 4 columns wide.
2. give each image a border so it looks like a card.
3. give each image a hover effect where the cursor turns into a pointer.

4. in the html, put 2 of each image from the images folder on the page.
5. Notice what we changed in the html to display a different image.
Use javascript instead of html to randomly place 2 of each image on the page.

6. Give each image a src that is a placeholder image, like the pokeball logo, and another attribute for the actual image src.

7. on click of an image, change it's src to whatever its data-src (or other attribute is)
